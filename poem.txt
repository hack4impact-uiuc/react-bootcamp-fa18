Hey guys!!
Sorry if this post appears to be pretty trash, this is my first post, probably my last since I'm so bad at this ;)
Either way though I just wanted to extort some extra RP from Riot so here goes nothing!

I woke up one day –
Feeling the squeeze,
The squeeze of not having,
Quite enough RP.

You see, some of ya’ll
You don’t worry at all.
You see, some of ya’ll
Can relieve your blue balls.

But not I, alas,
I work, I fast.
I have not the time,
I can’t even blast.

So some ask “why?”
Why don’t I have cash?
Well the answer is simple –
But please do not bash.

I am straight from Brazil,
I eat too many burrito.
I can only mid lane,
Pls no copy pasterino.

It isn’t that much;
The RP I request.
If you could spare a mere 20,
I would feel very blessed.

But if you shan’t –
You should pray to the stars.
Since I will be leaguing,
Shouting “BR BR BR”.
